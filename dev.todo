We're going to have a cron job that looks for all the medium posts and then creates
Post models on our end holding all the data we need.

We can potentially use a queue to handle this.

First, do a json request to fetch the fetured post, if it doesn't exist on our end, add it to the Article processing queue

Second, go over all of the most recent articles, doing the same thing.

Inside our processing queue handler, we would do reuqest to pull a specific article,
turning the json that's returned into a Post entry in the db, extracting relavent fields.

Lets also make sure to store the json from each article

Medium Service:

id => --
name => title
subtitle => content->subtitle
paragraph_1 => content->bodyModel->paragraphs[2]
paragraph_2 => content->bodyModel->paragraphs[3]
slug => uniqueSlug
latest_published_version => latestPublishedVersion
post_date => latestPublishedAt
medium_url => canonicalUrl
json =>
article_id => id
