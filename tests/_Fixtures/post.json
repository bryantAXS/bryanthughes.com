My comment mentioned it was great to see free work being appreciated by Nixon, and having it turn into a meaningful client relationship. The comments I got back, while not necessarily negative, mentioned how doing work for free undervalues the services being offered, and bring down rates within the industry, another common sentiment.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":17,"end":24,"href":"https://medium.com/design-ux/f85dc3457d04","title":"","rel":""},{"type":3,"start":44,"end":53,"href":"https://medium.com/@DannPetty","title":"","rel":""}]},{"name":"770e","type":1,"text":"My question is, why free work bad?

It’s a career where you’re always on the lookout for your next project, while at the same time, being presented with many non-ideal opportunities to “pay the bills.” Sure, everyone has a different set of goals for their careers, but mine would be having the opportunity to create web products within industries I am passionate about, and with clients helping to push those industries forward. To me, the excitement comes from both the actual build process and having the opportunity to collaborate with companies, and within industries, I admire.","markups":[{"type":1,"start":615,"end":618}]},{"name":"22b4","type":1,"text":"From a potential client’s point of view, most clients work their butts off to create a brand and personality that resonates with people.

No, sorry, it’s not. You just either don’t want, or don’t have the means, to take the same risk some do to land the project.

Instead of knocking these people for being nimble and risk tolerant, we should appreciate this path, and if not your own, adjust your process to better compete against it.","markups":[]},{"name":"4cf3","type":1,"text":"Can’t knock the hustle.","markups":[]}],"sections":[{"startIndex":0}]},"postDisplay":{"coverless":true}},"virtuals":{"statusForCollection":"","createdAtRelative":"2 years ago","updatedAtRelative":"2 years ago","acceptedAtRelative":"","createdAtEnglish":"October 6, 2013","updatedAtEnglish":"October 7, 2013","acceptedAtEnglish":"","firstPublishedAtEnglish":"October 6, 2013","latestPublishedAtEnglish":"October 7, 2013","allowNotes":true,"snippet":"Why is there such a stigma against pro bono work?
